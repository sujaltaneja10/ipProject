                The main purpose of creating a blogging website is to share the thoughts, ideas, knowledge, or experiences with wider audience on the internet. It provides a platform for an individual to express himself and connect with others who share similar interests, and potentially reach and engage with a broader community. Whether he is passionate about a specific topic, want to showcase his expertise, or simply enjoy writing, a blogging website allows anyone to publish and share content with the online world.
